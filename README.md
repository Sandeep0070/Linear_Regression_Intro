# Linear_Regression_Intro

PowerPoint presentation provides an introduction to linear regression in machine learning. 
The presentation covers various aspects of linear regression, including its definition, purpose, assumptions, and limitations. It explains the concepts of simple linear regression and multiple linear regression, highlighting their equations and training processes. The evaluation metrics for assessing the performance of linear regression models, such as mean squared error (MSE), R-squared (RÂ²), and root mean squared error (RMSE), are also discussed.

Real-world applications of linear regression, such as stock market prediction, sales forecasting, medical diagnosis, and weather prediction, are presented to showcase the algorithm's versatility. The presentation concludes by emphasizing the importance of appropriate evaluation metrics and highlights the widespread use of linear regression in various domains.

The PowerPoint presentation consists of 11 slides, including an agenda, introduction, definitions, examples, evaluation metrics, real-world applications, a conclusion, and a Q&A session. The presentation aims to provide a comprehensive overview of linear regression in machine learning and serve as a foundation for further exploration and understanding of this fundamental algorithm.
